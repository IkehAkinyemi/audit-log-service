# Audit Log Service ðŸ“»

This service is responsible for recording and querying logs that are sent by other systems. The service provides an Advanced Message Queuing Protocol for submitting logs data and a HTTP endpoint for querying recorded log data by field values.

## Event Types
The following are examples of logs that can be recorded:

- A new customer account was created for a given identity
- A customer performed an action on a resource
- A customer was billed a certain amount
- A customer account was deactivated

The list of log types is open-ended and new log types can be added without modifying the code. All logs should contain a common set of fields and a set of fields specific to the log type.

## Data Model
The service models an audit trail of logs with a schema that captures the invariant data content along with the variant, log-specific content. The service uses data storage mechanisms that are appropriate for the write-intensive nature of the service.

```
type Log struct {
	ID        primitive.ObjectID `bson:"_id"`
	Timestamp time.Time          `json:"created_at"`
	Action    string             `json:"action"`
	Actor     Actor              `json:"actor"`
	Entity    Entity             `json:"entity"`
	Context   Context            `json:"context"`
	Extension map[string]any     `json:"extension,omitempty"`
}
```
See [models](./internal/repository/model/model.go) for more info on the data model.

## API
The service is a microservice API that takes asychronous and synchronous approaches to solving the task of receiving, storing and retrieving logs. The API has the following HTTP endpoints:

- Service Registration
  - URL: `/v1/tokens/register`
  - Method: **POST**
  - Auth Required: No
  - Data Params: `{"service_id": "<service_identifier>"}`
  - Success Response:
    - Code: 201
    - Content: A new API key
  - Example:
    - ```curl -i -d "$DATA" http://localhost/v1/tokens/register```

- Reset Token
  - URL: `/v1/tokens/reset`
  - Method: **PATCH**
  - Auth Required: Yes
  - Data Params: `{"service_id": "<service_identifier>"}`
  - Success Response:
    - Code: 200
    - Content: A new API key
  - Example:
    - ```curl -i -d "$DATA" -H "Authorization: Key XXXX" http://localhost/v1/tokens/reset```

- Query Log 
  - URL: `/v1/logs`
  - Method: **GET**
  - Auth Required: Yes
  - Data Params: [Query parameters](./internal/utils/filter.go) containing the field values to filter the log by.
  - Success Response:
    - Code: 200
    - Content: List of logs that match the query
  - Example:
    - ```curl -i -H "Authorization: Key XXXX" 'http://localhost/v1/logs?action=createdstart_timestamp=2022-08-16T12:34:56Z'```

- Health check
  - URL: `/v1/ping`
  - Method: **GET**
  - Auth Required: No
  - Data Params: None
  - Success Response:
    - Code: 200
    - Content: Service healthe check data
  - Example:
    - ```curl -i http://localhost/v1/ping```

RabbitMQ is used to asynchronously handle log submission in the audit log service, meaning service can handle a high volume of logs without being blocked by the submission process.

This architecture is also fault-tolerant and robust, as the queue acts as a buffer, ensuring that logs are not lost even if the service is temporarily unavailable or unable to process them. See [example](./cmd/example/publisher.go) for implementation. See [run/example](#runexample) for usage.

## Prerequisites
- Go version 1.13 or higher
- [Docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04) and [docker-compose](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-20-04)
- [make(1)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/make.1.html) utility

## Deployment

The makefile included in this project provides several helpful commands to simplify the deployment and testing process.

The makefile includes the following commands:

### **help**

Prints a help message that lists all the commands in the makefile and their usage.

```
make help
```
### **run/service**
Runs the audit log service. It uses the `docker-compose` command to build and start the service, with the configuration specified in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

```
make run/service
```

### **run/example**
Runs the example application. It uses the `go run` command to start the example application, which can be used to submit log to the audit log service.

```
make run/example
```
> Note; Run the `make run/service` command to setup rabbitMQ before executing `make run/example` to publish logs.

### **test suite**
Runs the test suite for the service. It uses the `go test` command to run all the tests in the project, with the -v option to display verbose output.

```
make test
```
The makefile also includes the `.envrc` file which contains variable that are used in the makefile

### **Query logs**
To retrieve stored logs, you will first need to obtain an API Key using the **`/v1/register`** endpoint:

```
curl -i -d '{"service_id": "platform-12345"}' http://localhost/v1/tokens/register
```
Use the returned API key within the Authorization header in the next curl command to query logs like below:

```
curl -i -H "Authorization: Key <YOUR_API_KEY>" 'http://localhost/v1/logs?action=created&start_timestamp=2022-08-16T12:34:56Z'
```

## Future Work
- Added scalability and operational concerns that need to be addressed in the future.
  - Add/extend monitoring and observability capabilities to the service to aid troubleshooting and debugging.
  - Extending RabbitMQ to add a more robust mechanism for handling and retrying failed log submissions and consumption
  - Implement a mechanism for archiving or deleting old logs to keep the data storage size manageable.
  - Explore the use of a more robust data storage solution to handle the write-intensive nature of the service and improve performance.
  - Consider implementing a better approach to handling and processing large volumes of real-time logs.
  - Removing any unnecessary functionalities from the service, like authentication and querying. This allows the service to focus more on the write-ops domain.


- More (extensive) Testing
  - create and run table-driven unit tests and sub-tests to test cover more test scenarios. 
  - unit test the HTTP handlers and middleware.
  - perform â€˜end-to-endâ€™ testing of the web service routes, middleware, and handlers.
  - create mocks of the database models and use them in unit tests.
  - use a test instance of MongoDB to perform integration tests.
  - calculate and profile code coverage for the test suite.
